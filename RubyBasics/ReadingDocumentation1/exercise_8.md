## Exercise 8
### Locate and open the class documentation for the String class.

Under (http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/) there is a list of Classes.  I typed in "String" in the search field and the String class showed up.  I selected it and was brought to
(http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/String.html) which gives all of the class and instance methods for the String Class.
