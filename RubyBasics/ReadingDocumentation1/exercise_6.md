## Exercise 6
### Using the ruby documentation, determine how you would write a Symbol that represents your name. 
### We aren't looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which is one of ruby's datatypes.

We could go something like:
```ruby
:eric_ricketts
```
A symbol represents a name inside the Ruby interpreter.  Its value remains fixed for the duration of the program.
