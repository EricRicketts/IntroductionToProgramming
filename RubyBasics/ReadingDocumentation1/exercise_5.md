## Exercise 5
### Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to read.

```ruby
1234
1_234
```

These numbers have the same value, 1,234. The underscore may be used to enhance readability for humans. You may place an underscore anywhere in the number.
This includes the mantissa for Floating Point numbers.
