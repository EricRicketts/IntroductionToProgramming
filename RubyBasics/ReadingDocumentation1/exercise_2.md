## Exercise 2
### Locate the description of the while loop in the ruby documentation.

At ruby-doc.org, select the release version of Ruby you want (in my case I selected 2.3.1 core) and then on the web page for Ruby 2.3.1
select doc/syntax.rdoc.  On the syntax.rdoc page you will directed to doc/syntax/control_expressions.rdoc to find out about while loops
in Ruby.
